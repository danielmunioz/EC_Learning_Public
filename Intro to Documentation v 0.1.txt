RadioSpectraFlares (currently known as the "Flare_Downloader" Script in the new radiospectra package)

The Aim of the package is to set up a project(enviroment?) to download and read solar flares captured by the e-Callisto instruments, using a main list of 
flares detected (Monz 2010)

The script is build on top of the Radiospectra Package

The functionality can be divided in 2 main parts: 

-In case we have already dowloaded the Flares Database, we can use the script to navigate into the examples as well as extract some examples at will, 
we can also use the "Model_Utils" methods to normalize/use the data for machine learning purposes, an integration with tensorflow 2.0 may be currently in process

-In case we don't have the database already we can use the script itself to get one.

For both cases we need a "base" list with basic info such as Instrument, Date, Frequencies, and Time steps of the flares (The format of such a list is specified <here>)

Model_Utils (Can be found inside the "Learning" part)

Model Utils is used to try to normalize/preprocess the data in order to feed it to a Machine learning algorithm.

The standard usage is to begin creating and splitting the dataframe and list that contains the dataset, continuing
with "load_flare" wich slices and loads the data from a dataframe containing flares information into two python lists,
for the data itself and the labels respectively, then we can use "load_nonflare" to repeat the process but in a folder that does not cointains flares,
and then we can expand the dimensions of the data or apply background subtractions methods before fedding them to the machine learning part.

An Example of the usage can be found in the Train_bg notebook, note that the e-callisto dataset (with already bg_subt data) is necessary to run the notebook
